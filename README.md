# WebDevelopment2023
A place to organize learning materials and projects

Day 1, officialy at least: 
  - started a more in depth project for HTML and CSS, finished the html part and tomorrow I will do the css one. 
  - set up visual studio once again, even though sublime is great (learned some shortcuts too)

Day 2:
  - continued with the web project, finished the HTML and CSS for the About page, also edited the header and footer of the main page. 
  - got a bit lost with the arrangements, realised I don't understand the box model that good.
  - tomorrow I hope to complete the CSS part and then move to the Javascript one. I also need to read on flexbox. 

Day 3:
  - Revised old notes of CSS I've taken in 2020
  - Finished CSS-Diner all 32 levels, now I have a better grasp of selectors
  - Moved on to advanced CSS from the course, need to look more into a few subjects
  -Got a better understanding of the box model, managed to write to examples as to better understand the concept through practice. Practically I arranged two     divs, created a container and a square inside it which I positioned in different areas of the container. Need to check flex-box more and to get a better grasp   of pseudo-classes.
  - Did not finished the website project but will do that tomorrow.

Day 4:
  - Finished Advanced CSS, played around with the Robot exercise and created a simple image page with flexbox
  - read article for em, rem, vw,wh
  - read more about flexbox and its use compared to Grid
  - read about <position> and transitions / transformations
  - started working on the website project, not done yet
  - wanted to play flexbox froggy but didn't got the time, will do tomorrow

  <strong>Day 5</strong>:
  - finished the index part of the band website, almost finished the store too, still have the cart section and a bit from merch
  - tomorrow I should be done with the website, will try to implement javascript to the cart function from a tutorial, also will try and do as much from bootstrap section
  - only coded for 2 hours and a half, busy day and time seems to be running faster than Usain Bolt
  
<strong>Day 6</strong>:
  - Only coded for two hours and a half today but managed to finish the Red Hot Chili Peppers website. It looks nice and it's the first project that I've did. I will implement some Javascript in it later.
  - managed to debug code on my own and figure out what and where the problem is by inspecting the webpage and understanding how the containers are wrapped and which class contains specific items. Got a bit annoyed with the absurd amount of classes but slowly getting used to it.

<strong> Day 7 </strong>:
  - Continued with bootstrap today, created a new page and played around with bootstrap functionalities
  - learned about Sass and CDN, as well as frameworks
  - read a bit about Ruby on Rails
  - started the startup page project, trying to do it on my own. It should have been pretty simple but tried a different design and got stuck, and annoyed, arranging the containers so that the site would be responsive. Also, for some reason, encountered stupid errors, like background not displaying. Fixed the problem by restarting the virtual server and moving my folders in the right place, and so on.
  - realized that problems do and will occur from now one, I must be patient and try solving them one by one
  - also trying to advance at a slower pace as of the fact that I have this weird urge to rush and learn as much as possible, as fast as possible
  
<strong> Day 8 </strong>:
  - managed to finish my own startup page, which was actually a pre-order page for a game
  - learned more about git, cause I pretty much forgot everything I've learnt before
  - learnt how to set my website live through github
  - played around with github for desktop, should learn to use git commands through the console tho
  - I finally understand bootstrap a little better, flexbox too (cause I've spent way too much testing different containers and sizes)
  - played around with transitions and animations, must do a more detailed website with them
  - almost to javascript, do I even remember the syntax?
  - hoping to be able to get an intership in March or April
  - tomorrow I want to try a bit of azure, and python combined with flask (just so to have a basic understanding)
  
<strong> Day 9 </strong>: 
   - did not code that much today but read a lot and finished with grid section and the career of a web dev. Can't wait to get back to actually programming in Javascript, enough CSS for a while.   
   - finished flexbox froggy to revise what I know, also almost finished the gridbox one 
   - played around with grid, pretty much understood how to use it 
   - now I know that flexbox is used mainly for one dimension applications while grid for two dimensions, bootstrap appeared before them 
   - tomorrow I will do the grid project on my own and then start javascript
   
 <strong> Day 10 </strong>: 
  - finished grid garden
  - finished the grid project on my own, took about 4 hours. Used animations, media queries, gradients, grid, flexbox and so on. 
  - learnt more about responsiveness, backgrounds, gradients and grid system
  - used animations from the Animate.css
  - proud that I've managed to do the template on my own, even though it was a bit frustrating. Oficially I now have 10 days, way to go till 100!
  - time to start Javascript
  
  <strong> Day 11 </strong>:
  - started and almost finished Javascript, still have a bit of for loops to practice
  - longest day of coding since started, 7 hours (my head hurts)
  - revised my old notes, looked at different elements, like primitives, functions, methods, arrays, object and loops
  - fought with visual studio to manage to run javascript, installed node and code-runners plugin
  - fought some more to understand how to properly run code in vs, got stuck with code that wasn't working because "prompt" was not declared until I finally understood that is because in node it's actually readline
  - DRY (Try to do not repeat myself and have clean code)
  - did the javascript exercises on my own, struggled with why my "facebook" database wouldn't run (cause obsiouly I had no HTML attached...)
  - learnt more about visual studio a bit and plugins
  - also got 20 days of daily writing a minimum of 750 words (another challenge I've started, from 750words.com) 

  <strong> Day 12 </strong>:
  - finished Javascript, revised for loops and forEach
  - updated the database exercise with for loops 
  - started Document Object Model (DOM)

  - learnt about jQuerry (imperative) and React (declarative)
  
  <strong> Day 14 </strong>
  - read about callback functions, again. Learnt about .map, array.from, this, const vs var vs let, scope and arrow function expression which I still find a bit confusion
  - asked a question on stackoverflow and realized I don't understand half of the answer so I've researched more
  - finished the dom exercise, realized I needed to use this plus get the array from ul and then call on that the toggle function, also changed to for loop to forEach
  - spent time trying to understand the logic behind what I wish to do in a function, and also how Javascript works
  
  <strong> Day 15 </strong>:
   - finally finished the task app, took me way too much to understand DOM and I still don't feel secure about it
   - still need to finish the background project in dom section
   - started javascript, read about scope, ternary operators, switch, event.target
   - started ECMA script part, learnt that Babel is a Javascript compiler
   - learnt about destructuring, var, const and let again
   - arrow functions are fun
   - completed two weeks of daily coding

  <strong> Day 16 </strong>:
  - oh man oh man, forgot to update the github with the files I've worked with today, it was a full day and I've somehow forgot to upload in time. It's 13 minutes after midnight come on...
  - ignoring the above, today was a day for javascript
  - learnt about destructuring, worked a bit on it to understand it better, arrays and methods
  - learnt about classes again, practiced a bit to be sure I understand the constructor logic

  - long day, happy I've managed to make time to code, even if only for a couple of hours
  
  <strong> Day 18 </strong>:
  - another long day, half way through with my bachelor degree final project, glad I've got to code a bit
  - javascript day, advanced arrays (map, filter, reduce), advanced objects (reference types, primitives, context vs scope, instantiation), keyword "new"
