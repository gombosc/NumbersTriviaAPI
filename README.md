# WebDevelopment2023
A place to organize learning materials and projects

Day 1, officialy at least: 
  - started a more in depth project for HTML and CSS, finished the html part and tomorrow I will do the css one. 
  - set up visual studio once again, even though sublime is great (learned some shortcuts too)

Day 2:
  - continued with the web project, finished the HTML and CSS for the About page, also edited the header and footer of the main page. 
  - got a bit lost with the arrangements, realised I don't understand the box model that good.
  - tomorrow I hope to complete the CSS part and then move to the Javascript one. I also need to read on flexbox. 

Day 3:
  - Revised old notes of CSS I've taken in 2020
  - Finished CSS-Diner all 32 levels, now I have a better grasp of selectors
  - Moved on to advanced CSS from the course, need to look more into a few subjects
  -Got a better understanding of the box model, managed to write to examples as to better understand the concept through practice. Practically I arranged two     divs, created a container and a square inside it which I positioned in different areas of the container. Need to check flex-box more and to get a better grasp   of pseudo-classes.
  - Did not finished the website project but will do that tomorrow.

Day 4:
  - Finished Advanced CSS, played around with the Robot exercise and created a simple image page with flexbox
  - read article for em, rem, vw,wh
  - read more about flexbox and its use compared to Grid
  - read about <position> and transitions / transformations
  - started working on the website project, not done yet
  - wanted to play flexbox froggy but didn't got the time, will do tomorrow

  <strong>Day 5</strong>:
  - finished the index part of the band website, almost finished the store too, still have the cart section and a bit from merch
  - tomorrow I should be done with the website, will try to implement javascript to the cart function from a tutorial, also will try and do as much from bootstrap section
  - only coded for 2 hours and a half, busy day and time seems to be running faster than Usain Bolt
  
<strong>Day 6<strong>:
  - Only coded for two hours and a half today but managed to finish the Red Hot Chili Peppers website. It looks nice and it's the first project that I've did. I will implement some Javascript in it later.
  - managed to debug code on my own and figure out what and where the problem is by inspecting the webpage and understanding how the containers are wrapped and which class contains specific items. Got a bit annoyed with the absurd amount of classes but slowly getting used to it.
