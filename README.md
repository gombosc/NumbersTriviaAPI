# WebDevelopment2023
A place to organize learning materials and projects

Day 1, officialy at least: 
- started a more in depth project for HTML and CSS, finished the html part and tomorrow I will do the css one. 
- set up visual studio once again, even though sublime is great (learned some shortcuts too)

Day 2:
- continued with the web project, finished the HTML and CSS for the About page, also edited the header and footer of the main page. 
- got a bit lost with the arrangements, realised I don't understand the box model that good.
- tomorrow I hope to complete the CSS part and then move to the Javascript one. I also need to read on flexbox. 

Day 2:
- Revised old notes of CSS I've taken in 2020
- Finished CSS-Diner all 32 levels, now I have a better grasp of selectors
- Moved on to advanced CSS from the course, need to look more into a few subjects
-Got a better understanding of the box model, managed to write to examples as to better understand the concept through practice. Practically I arranged two divs, created a container and a square inside it which I positioned in different areas of the container. Need to check flex-box more and to get a better grasp of pseudo-classes.
- Did not finished the website project but will do that tomorrow.
