# WebDevelopment2023
A place to organize learning materials and projects

Day 1, officialy at least: 
- started a more in depth project for HTML and CSS, finished the html part and tomorrow I will do the css one. 
- set up visual studio once again, even though sublime is great (learned some shortcuts too)
